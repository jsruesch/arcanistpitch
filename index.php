You are drawn inside, where you discover the scriptorium of the Arcanist--a library full of endless books detailing how to use magic. Hesitant at first, you begin to grow bolder. You lay your hands on one particularly dusty tome that seems to glow with an eerie light. It immediately unleashes a curse that traps you in the tower.
